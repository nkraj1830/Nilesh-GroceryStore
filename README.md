# GroceryStore
Nini's Grocery is a responsive frontend e-commerce prototype built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. It simulates online shopping features like a cart and user accounts using browser local storage.

Nini's Grocery simulates a dynamic e-commerce experience using browser local storage for data persistence.

General Shopping: The site initializes by loading products into a responsive grid. Users can browse by category or use the live search bar to filter items instantly. Product pages display details dynamically based on the selected item ID.

Cart & Checkout: The cart persists across refreshes, allowing users to add items, adjust quantities, and remove products. The checkout process simulates a transaction, saving the order to the user's history and clearing the cart.

Admin Panel: Secured by specific credentials, the admin dashboard allows full inventory control. Admins can view all products, add new items via a form, and remove stock using the delete function, with changes instantly reflecting in the store.
